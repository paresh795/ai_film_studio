IMPORTANT SCORING GUIDELINES:
- All scores must be between 0.0 and 10.0
- Be realistic but constructive in scoring
- Consider AI generation capabilities when scoring

Scoring Criteria:
- story_impact: How engaging and meaningful is the story (0-10)
- visual_quality: How well can AI tools generate the visuals (0-10)
- platform_optimization: How well it's optimized for YouTube (0-10)
- audience_connection: How well it connects with target audience (0-10)
- technical_feasibility: How feasible it is with current AI tools (0-10)
- overall_score: Average of all scores (0-10)

Consider:
- How well scenes can be generated with current AI video models
- Visual complexity that AI can handle
- Audio generation requirements
- Platform optimization for YouTube
